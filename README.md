Shareholder Voting App for AGMs
A modern, secure web application designed specifically for businesses to manage shareholder voting during Annual General Meetings (AGMs). Unlike typical polling tools, this app uses weighted voting based on share ownership, ensuring accurate representation of shareholder influence.

Built with Firebase, SvelteKit, SMUI, JS and Node.js, the app offers a streamlined experience with role-based user access, secure authentication, and robust admin tools for managing shareholder profiles, shares, and permissions.

Key features include:

✅ Weighted voting system based on shareholding

✅ Proxy voting support

✅ Role-based access for admins and shareholders

✅ Data visualization of vote outcomes

✅ Easy data exporting for record-keeping

✅ Admin dashboard for managing shareholders and shares

Designed out of necessity, this app fills a gap in the market for tailored, share-weighted AGM voting solutions — perfect for businesses, yet flexible enough for broader voting use cases.
